# no_pw_apt_update
bash script: sudo apt update and sudo apt upgrade without having to enter your password. 
I get annoyed when I have to enter my password so often in Linux. Yes I am very aware of the risks and the dangers but this isn't my work machine it's just my crappy every-day use that I check the weather and edit the Marlin or Klipper firmwares for my 3d printers. Oh and I also feel I should mention I am not a coder or a developer, more like a dabbler. But these days I'm a dabbler with ChatGPT! So I asked it to write this for me and after 4 or 5 iterations of fixing error messages or adding to it, it does exactly what I want it to do and all I have to do is type up.

So what is does is to automatically enter sudo apt update, if there are system files it does sudo apt dist-upgrade if they are not system files it just does regular sudo apt upgrade. If autoremove is mentioned it does that too. So I took this code and made a file in a directory that is already in the $PATH and named the file "up". You have to do the chmod +x to make it executable and you have to edit the file and replace <YOUR_PASSWORD> with your actual password (Like I said I'm not concerned there's nothing on this laptop that if anyone had could hurt me with so use at your own risk.

I'm only putting it here in case somebody might be as password-annoyed (maybe somewhat password-lazy) as I am. You can do whatever you want with it. Cheers!
